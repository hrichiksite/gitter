# Communities

A community holds many rooms.

Communities are also referred to as "groups" internally in the codebase.


## Community creation

Use the **+** -> **Create community** option in the bottom-left of the menu bar to start the community creation process.

### Associate your community with GitLab

If you sign in with GitLab, communities can be associated with a [GitLab group](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/) or [project](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/). Just click the link in the "do you want to start a community for one of your GitLab groups/projects?" phrase below the name and URI inputs.

Gitter communities based on your personal GitLab user namespace are not supported yet but we plan to follow up soon after -> https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/-/issues/2397


### Associate your community with GitHub

If you sign in with GitHub, communities can be associated with a GitHub organisation or repo. Just click the link in the "do you want to start a community for one of your GitHub orgs/repos?" phrase below the name and URI inputs.

If you don't see the GitHub org/repo listed that you want to associate, see [*Why isn't my GitHub organisation or repos appearing?* FAQ](./faq.md#why-isnt-my-github-organisation-or-repos-appearing).

## Community admins

You can add new admins for a room by visiting a room in the community -> **Room settings dropdown** -> **Permissions** modal -> **Edit community permissions**


## Rename a community

If you want to rename a community because a GitHub org/repo was renamed/transferred, see this [FAQ section instead](./faq.md#what-happens-if-i-rename-something-on-GitHub-org-repo) instead.

Currently, there isn't a way to rename a community in the UI. But you can send a message to support@gitter.im with the following info. Make sure to email with the primary email address associated with the GitLab/GitHub/Twitter account tied to your Gitter account.

 - Link to the current Gitter community
 - Desired community name


## Delete a community

Currently, there isn't a way to delete a community in the UI.
Even if you delete all the rooms, it is still accessible via your community home, most likely `https://gitter.im/YOUR-COMMUNITY/home`

If you want to delete a community, send an email to support@gitter.im with a link
and any confirmation needed to verify your identity. Please use the primary email
associated with your account so I can verify easier.
